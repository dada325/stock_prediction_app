# Stock prediction using FinGPT and FinRL


## Machine Learning Enginnering is 10% of Machine Learning, and 90% of Enginnering.

  When I First heard this, I am astonished, almost stun. For that all the way in the colleage, we have been learning the Machine learning the way that how we manupulate the data adn Algorithm to let the computer "think", but in fact, making a good application is not just having the best data, the efficient Algorithm. It is always the Enginnering, the trade off, the big effort to make the new function up and running online. 

## Hight level design of Pipeline and data flywheel 



## I am going to redo the app with the new idea of using FinGPT (for sentiment analysis) and FinRL Meta (for batch data training)


### 1. Problem Understanding and Definition

#### Objective:
- **Document**: Write a formal Problem Statement document.
  - Define the exact stock indices or companies you're focusing on.
  - Outline the prediction horizon (e.g., daily, weekly).

#### Significance and Impact:
- Conduct a market analysis to demonstrate the demand for such a product.
- Identify potential financial metrics to quantify the impact (e.g., ROI).

#### Deliverables:
- Problem Statement document.
- Market Analysis report.

### 2. Data Collection and Exploration

#### Data Sources:
- Sign contracts with data providers for accurate and up-to-date stock market data.

#### Data Gathering:
- **Code**: Write ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) scripts to collect data.
- **Database**: Store the raw data in a scalable database like AWS RDS or Azure SQL Database.

#### Initial Exploration:
- **Quality Check**: Implement automated checks for missing values and anomalies.

#### Deliverables:
- ETL code repository.
- Database schema.
- Data Quality report.

---

### 3. Data Preprocessing

#### Missing Values:
- Implement imputation algorithms tailored for time-series data, like forward-fill or interpolation.

#### Outliers:
- Use Z-score or Tukey's method to identify outliers and replace them.

#### Data Transformation:
- Use Min-Max scaling or Z-score normalization.

#### Deliverables:
- Preprocessing code repository.
- Cleaned Data in a separate database table or schema.

### 4. Feature Engineering

#### Technical Indicators:
- Calculate technical indicators like SMA, EMA, RSI, and MACD.
  
#### Market Indicators:
- Add features like market sentiment, news sentiment, or S&P 500 performance.

#### Feature Selection:
- Run algorithms like Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE).

#### Deliverables:
- Feature Engineering code repository.
- Dataset with engineered features stored in a database.

---

### 5. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

#### Visualizations:
- Generate interactive dashboards using tools like Tableau or Power BI.
  
#### Correlations:
- Compute Spearman and Pearson correlation coefficients for all features.

#### Deliverables:
- EDA Dashboard.
- EDA report.

---

### 6. Model Selection and Training

#### Algorithm Selection:
- Conduct literature reviews or pilot studies to select algorithms.

#### Data Split:
- Use Walk-Forward Validation or Time Series Split for more accurate evaluation.

#### Backtesting:
- Develop a backtesting engine to simulate trades and calculate performance metrics like Sharpe ratio.

#### Model Training and Tuning:
- Use hyperparameter tuning libraries like Optuna or Hyperopt.

#### Evaluation:
- Calculate error metrics (e.g., RMSE, MAE) and financial metrics (e.g., ROI from backtesting).

#### Deliverables:
- Trained models stored in a Model Repository.
- Backtesting report.
- Model Evaluation report.

---

### Second Phase:

#### Deployment:
- Use Docker containers or cloud services like AWS SageMaker for deployment.

#### Monitoring and Maintenance:
- Implement automated monitoring using Grafana or custom dashboards.
- Schedule periodic retraining of the model.

#### Deliverables:
- Deployment guide.
- Monitoring Dashboard.
  

### 1. Web App Development Process:

Once you have a trained agent, you can integrate it into a web app for user interaction. Here's a general workflow:

#### a. **Backend Development**:
- **Model Serving**: Use a framework like Flask or FastAPI to serve the trained model. The backend will handle requests to get trading actions based on the latest data.
- **Data Streaming**: Integrate with a real-time data provider to get live stock prices. This can be done using websockets or RESTful APIs, depending on the data source.

#### b. **Frontend Development**:
- Develop a user interface using a framework like React, Vue, or Angular.
- Display real-time stock prices and the trading actions recommended by the RL agent.
- Optionally, show historical performance metrics, charts, and other relevant information.

#### c. **Deploying the App**:
- Use cloud providers like AWS, Azure, or GCP to deploy your backend.
- Use services like Netlify, Vercel, or traditional web hosts for the frontend.

#### d. **Continuous Monitoring & Retraining**:
- Continuously monitor the agent's performance. If the strategy starts underperforming, consider retraining the agent with newer data.
- Ensure the app handles errors gracefully, especially when dealing with live financial data and trading decisions.


### 2. Monitoring and Maintenance:

### 3. 

### Important Points:

- **User Safety**: Always include disclaimers stating that the trading strategy is based on simulations and past performance is not indicative of future results. It's essential to ensure users are aware of the risks.
  
- **Testing**: Before deploying, rigorously test the app in a sandbox or simulated environment. Financial applications can have significant repercussions if there's a bug.

- **Security**: Given that you're dealing with financial data, ensure that the app is secure. Use HTTPS, secure any databases or data storage, and regularly update and patch your systems.

Remember, while FinRL provides tools to develop and train RL-based trading strategies, deploying them in a real-world scenario requires careful consideration and thorough testing.
