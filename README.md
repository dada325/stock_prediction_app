# Stock prediction using FinGPT and FinRL


## Machine Learning Enginnering is 10% of Machine Learning, and 90% of Enginnering.

  When I First heard this, I am astonished, almost stun. For that all the way in the colleage, we have been learning the Machine learning the way that how we manupulate the data adn Algorithm to let the computer "think", but in fact, making a good application is not just having the best data, the efficient Algorithm. It is always the Enginnering, the trade off, the big effort to make the new function up and running online. 

## Hight level design of Pipeline and data flywheel 



## I am going to redo the app with the new idea of using FinGPT (for sentiment analysis) and FinRL Meta (for batch data training)

### First, using FinRL-Meta to train a Agent locally. Doing Back-testing to evaluate the result. 

### 1. Training a Strategy with FinRL-Meta:

#### a. **Data Collection**:
- Gather historical stock price data. This can be daily, intraday, or any frequency that suits your strategy. You can use APIs like Yahoo Finance, Alpha Vantage, or other data providers.

- Do the EDA

#### b. **Data Preprocessing**:
- Process the data to compute various indicators or features, like moving averages, RSI, etc. FinRL provides utilities for this.

#### c. **Defining the Environment**:
- Using FinRL, you can define a custom trading environment or use the ones provided by the library.

#### d. **Training the Agent**:
- Choose an RL algorithm (like DDPG, PPO, A3C, etc.). FinRL provides implementations of these algorithms.
- Train the agent on the historical data. The agent learns a policy that maximizes the expected rewards (like portfolio value).

#### e. **Evaluation**:
- After training, evaluate the agent's performance on validation or test data. Check metrics like cumulative returns, Sharpe ratio, drawdown, etc.

### 2. Web App Development Process:

Once you have a trained agent, you can integrate it into a web app for user interaction. Here's a general workflow:

#### a. **Backend Development**:
- **Model Serving**: Use a framework like Flask or FastAPI to serve the trained model. The backend will handle requests to get trading actions based on the latest data.
- **Data Streaming**: Integrate with a real-time data provider to get live stock prices. This can be done using websockets or RESTful APIs, depending on the data source.

#### b. **Frontend Development**:
- Develop a user interface using a framework like React, Vue, or Angular.
- Display real-time stock prices and the trading actions recommended by the RL agent.
- Optionally, show historical performance metrics, charts, and other relevant information.

#### c. **Deploying the App**:
- Use cloud providers like AWS, Azure, or GCP to deploy your backend.
- Use services like Netlify, Vercel, or traditional web hosts for the frontend.

#### d. **Continuous Monitoring & Retraining**:
- Continuously monitor the agent's performance. If the strategy starts underperforming, consider retraining the agent with newer data.
- Ensure the app handles errors gracefully, especially when dealing with live financial data and trading decisions.

### Important Points:

- **User Safety**: Always include disclaimers stating that the trading strategy is based on simulations and past performance is not indicative of future results. It's essential to ensure users are aware of the risks.
  
- **Testing**: Before deploying, rigorously test the app in a sandbox or simulated environment. Financial applications can have significant repercussions if there's a bug.

- **Security**: Given that you're dealing with financial data, ensure that the app is secure. Use HTTPS, secure any databases or data storage, and regularly update and patch your systems.

Remember, while FinRL provides tools to develop and train RL-based trading strategies, deploying them in a real-world scenario requires careful consideration and thorough testing.
