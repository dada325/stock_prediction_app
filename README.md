## Machine Learning Enginnering is 10% of Machine Learning, and 90% of Enginnering.

  When I First heard this, I am astonished, almost stun. For that all the way in the colleage, we have been learning the Machine learning the way that how we manupulate the data adn Algorithm to let the computer "think", but in fact, making a good application is not just having the best data, the efficient Algorithm. It is always the Enginnering, the trade off, the big effort to make the new function up and running online. 

## Just a recap of how to deploy the ML system
